# What the project does
This project analyses street-level crime patterns in London using data from the UK Police API and OpenStreetMap (OSM). The project includes data collection, processing, and a Shiny web application for interactive visualisation exploration.

This project has social science significance by examining how crime is unevenly distributed across space, time, and crime categories in London. By integrating crime data with police station locations, it provides insight into spatial inequality in urban safety and the distribution of policing resources. The interactive visualisations further support social scientific analysis by making complex crime patterns accessible and interpretable.
# How users can get started with the project
The project is organised as an RStudio Project (.Rproj), which automatically sets the working directory to the project root. All scripts and the Shiny application use relative file paths. And all required R packages are explicitly loaded at the beginning of the scripts.

The R version needed for this project is 4.5.1 (2025-06-13).

The compressed project folder contains:
- R scripts (`.R`)  
- Datasets (`.csv`)  
- README file(`.md`)  
- The main report (`.html`)  
- Shiny App (`.R`)
- Assignment coversheet
- The project (`.Rproj`)

Data sources:
- UK Police API
- OpenStreetMap (OSM)

Data were collected programmatically using API requests. Due to API rate limits and long runtimes (more than 1 hour), the processed datasets are included in the data/ directory to ensure reproducibility and ease of assessment.
